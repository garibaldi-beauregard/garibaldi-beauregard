- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @garibaldi-beauregard
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in CI/CD, DevOps, IaC, CaC, AI/ML, and a whole host of other things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning stuff that I don't get to do at work, like K8s, alternate CI tooling, open source, etc.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to just message me on GitHub if for some reason you think my involvement would somehow be helpful!
